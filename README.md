SeedLock is a direct-purpose security utility. It provides core functionalities for data encryption and decryption, designed to manage information confidentiality. For authentication, SeedLock incorporates a custom password hashing process. This process is structured to apply multiple hashing iterations, integrate additional random hash values, and utilize a unique, randomized 'seed' (or salt) with each password. This approach aims to enhance the resistance against common attacks such as rainbow tables and brute-force attempts by increasing the computational work required. Notably, SeedLock is engineered with a global re-keying feature; in the event of a security breach, updating the master seed and re-hashing stored passwords allows for immediate invalidation of prior hashes, serving as a rapid response mechanism. SeedLock provides a self-implemented layer for managing digital data and user authentication.
